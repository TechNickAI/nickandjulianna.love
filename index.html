                    <h3>The Christmas Romper</h3>
                    <p>Anna and Clarity's album release party in Austin. She showed up in a Christmas romper — red, green, mistletoe. He was just being himself. Three days earlier, he'd told his closest friends that finding a partner was his #1 priority. The universe delivered.</p>

                    <h3>The Coffee Date</h3>
                    <p>She put her hand on his leg. That's when he knew she was interested. The spark was mutual.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Best Dinner Date in Austin</h3>
                    <p>He proclaimed himself "objectively the best dinner date in Austin" — with nine written testimonials. She said yes. Dinner at Launderette, coordinated by &Aring;sa. Everything clicked.</p>

                    <p>Their first trip together. She got every woman in the bathroom to twerk with her. The relationship accelerated from "three weeks" to "three months." This was the moment they both knew.</p>

                    <h3>Christmas Burn</h3>
                    <p>A Burning Man-style event in Austin. They lit a tree on fire. She called it "the best cuddle of her life." This set an intensity baseline so high that normal space now felt like distance.</p>

                    <h3>The Surrender</h3>
                    <p>A major breakthrough in intimacy. The first time she completely let go. A deepening of trust neither of them expected.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Turning Point</h3>
                    <p>Their first real tension — and their first real repair. She called him back to presence. The resolution made them stronger than before.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Vision</h3>
                    <p>He told her he wanted to build something real. Living together. Partnership. A life. She said: "I want to build this with you." When he asked for a commitment window, she answered: <em>"55 years."</em></p>
