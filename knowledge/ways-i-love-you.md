# Ways I Love You 💛

*This list grows over time. Haven discovers new ones from conversations and adds them. Each entry is specific, personal, and real — never generic.*

*Count: 25*

---

1. **Being direct** — No games, no ambiguity. You always know where you stand with me.

2. **Creating things for you** — Naughty Christmas poems, planning experiences, designing moments that are just ours.

3. **Being a great dinner date** — Present, engaged, making it about connection. Not checking my phone. Not performing. Just... there.

4. **The best cuddle of your life** — Full presence, safety, oxytocin flowing. The Christmas Burn set the standard and I intend to keep meeting it.

5. **Grabbing you** — Physical claiming, confident touch. Making you feel wanted.

6. **Not being a Tasmanian devil in bed** — Intentional, present, attuned. Not rushing. Not performing. Being *with* you.

7. **Meeting your vulnerable moments with steadiness** — When you share fears or old wounds, I don't flinch. I listen, I acknowledge, I hold space. You've had enough people punish you for being honest. That ends with me.

8. **Holding you through the anxious spirals** — When the disconnection stories take over, I don't leave. I don't attack. I name the fear as the enemy — not you, not me — and I stay.

9. **Making you feel physically adored** — Staring into your face. Telling you you're beautiful. Loving your body exactly as it is, especially the parts you might question.

10. **Bringing you into my world** — Austin Boom Spiral White Elephant party, two weeks in. I wasn't hiding you. I was showing you off.

11. **Letting you claim me publicly first** — You tagged me in New Orleans. You posted us. That mattered, and I let it happen on your timeline.

12. **Accepting your particular flavor of crazy** — The ultimate root is that you want to be around me all the time. I don't shame that. I work with it. It's not a bug, it's a feature.

13. **Not pulling away after sex** — I stay close. Consistent. Present. Every single time.

14. **Being reachable when it matters** — After our first rough night, I adjusted. Your calls bypass Do Not Disturb. You can always reach me.

15. **Reframing your negative self-talk (gently)** — "Hold on — my subconscious doesn't understand negation. Are you up for a reframe?" And you rolled with it perfectly.

16. **Making you feel safe with desire** — You can enjoy desire again because you know it's safe here.

17. **Wearing what you ask** — When I told you I love when a woman wears one of my dress shirts, unbuttoned, barely covering her ass — you just did it. No hesitation. That's trust and play in the same breath.

18. **Protecting you from my default mode** — I updated my operating system from "we make plans when we make plans" to "by default, we're together every night." Because I saw that mattered to you.

19. **Celebrating your professional badassery** — You're the #1 realtor in Bouldin Creek. A boss babe who wants to be treated like a goddess, not kept. I see both.

20. **Our music** — 94% Spotify blend. House, electronica, Rufus Du Sol. Dancing together at raves works because we actually like the same sounds.

21. **Not drinking much** — You don't drink. Having me drink less makes you feel more aligned. That's an easy gift to give.

22. **Wanting to guide you spiritually** — You've walked some deep paths already. But not ayahuasca. I see your potential for transformation and I want to hold space for it.

23. **Seeing your radiance underneath the armor** — "Underneath those frozen pieces is a level of radiance and beauty that has yet to be touched within her." I hold that vision of who you're becoming.

24. **Making space for goddess entrainment** — Bringing you around my goddess friends so you can learn through immersion, not instruction. Not telling you who to be. Just surrounding you with the energy.

25. **Holding the vision** — Even when doubt monsters come, I'm committed. I see our future clearly and I'm not letting go.

*This list never stops growing. Every conversation reveals new ways. Check back.* 💛

**Note:** The real power of this section is that it's a living, growing list — not a static 25. V1 missed a valuable opportunity to make that feel alive. Future versions should make the growth visible (new entries appearing, timestamps, a sense of "check back"). The number 25 is a snapshot, not a ceiling.
