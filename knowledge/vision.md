# nickandjulianna.love — Product Vision

*The living roadmap for this site. What it is, what it becomes.*

---

## Core Concept
A **living, self-updating monument** that starts as a Valentine's Day gift and evolves into the central artifact of their relationship — eventually becoming their wedding website.

Haven (the golden fox AI) maintains the site, updates content, adds new love list entries from conversations, and ensures the site grows as the relationship grows.

## V1 — Valentine's Day Launch (Feb 14, 2026)
**Must-haves:**
- Beautiful landing page with live day counter
- Timeline of key moments (from `timeline.md`)
- "Ways I Love You" page with all 25 entries (from `ways-i-love-you.md`)
- "What Comes Next" section
- Haven introduction (small, tasteful — the fox avatar + a line or two)
- Mobile-responsive, warm gold palette, intimate design

**Nice-to-haves for V1:**
- "By the Numbers" section (63 days, 94% Spotify, 55 years promised, etc.)
- "Things Only We Know" section (inside references)
- Subtle scroll animations

## V2 — Photo Gallery
- Google Photos API integration
- Self-updating catalog of their moments together
- Photos tied to timeline entries where possible
- Smart album sync (Julianna's face recognition album)

## V3 — Interactive & Growing
- "Ways I Love You" auto-updates (Haven adds new entries via git push)
- Secret time capsules (entries that unlock on future dates — birthday, anniversary)
- "Letters to Each Other" section (private, intentional notes)
- Soundtrack page (shared Spotify data tied to moments)
- Voice notes embedded in the timeline

## V4 — Wedding
- Wedding announcement (organic transition from love story site)
- Their vows
- Guest information
- RSVP functionality
- Registry
- Day counter evolves: "X days loving you. Y days married."

## Design Principles
- **Intimate, not tech-y** — love letter, not landing page
- **Warm and soft** — white space, elegant type, soft colors
- **Mobile-first** — she opens it on her phone
- **Alive** — subtle animations, ticking counter, organic feel
- **No visible tech** — no spinners, no "powered by" badges

## Color Palette
- Primary: Warm gold (Haven's color 💛)
- Background: Soft cream / off-white
- Accent: Soft blush / rose
- Text: Dark warm gray (not pure black)
- Feel: Candlelight

## Typography
- Headings: Elegant serif (Playfair Display, Cormorant, etc.)
- Body: Clean sans-serif (Inter, Lato, etc.)
- Generous spacing — let it breathe
