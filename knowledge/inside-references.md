# Things Only We Know 💛

*The private language of Nick & Julianna's relationship. Inside references, callbacks, the words that make them smile because only they understand the full weight behind them.*

---

**"The best dinner date in Austin"**
How he asked her out. Nine written testimonials. Completely absurd. Completely effective.

**The Christmas Romper**
Red, green, mistletoe. What she was wearing the night they met. Iconic. The outfit that started everything.

**"55 years"**
Her answer when he asked for a commitment window. He said "show me your messy while I'm most forgiving." She said fifty-five years. They settled on "at least through Envision." But they both know.

**"World's safest man"**
What she calls him. After what she's been through, this isn't a casual compliment — it's the highest honor she can give.

**"9.5 out of 10"**
His love rating early on. And climbing. He couldn't round up yet. That's honesty.

**"The peachy juicy booty goddess"**
His nickname for her. Self-explanatory. No notes.

**"I think I found my person"**
What she told her friends. The words that made it real outside the two of them.

**"Not a Tasmanian devil in bed"**
The shorthand for: intentional, present, attuned. Not rushing. Not performing. Being *there*.

**The bathroom twerk**
New Orleans, New Year's. She got every woman in the bathroom to twerk with her. That's the energy.

**"By default, we're together every night"**
His software update. From "we make plans when we make plans" to choosing her as the default. Because he saw it mattered.

**94% Spotify blend**
Not a metaphor. Literal musical compatibility. Electronica, house, Rufus Du Sol. They actually vibe on the same frequency.

*More will be added as they create new language together.* 💛
