# Things Only We Know 💛

*The private language of Nick & Julianna's relationship. Inside references, callbacks, the words that make them smile because only they understand the full weight behind them.*

---

**"The best dinner date in Austin"**
How he asked her out. Nine written testimonials. Absurd. And it worked.

**The Christmas Romper**
Red, green, mistletoe. What she was wearing the night they met. Iconic. The outfit that started everything.

**"55 years"**
Her answer when he asked for a commitment window. He said "show me your messy while I'm most forgiving." She said fifty-five years. They settled on "at least through Envision." But they both know.

**"The perfect body"**
He means it. Every curve, every detail. He could not have designed a better one if he tried.

**"I think I found my person"**
What she told her friends. The words that made it real outside the two of them.

**"Not a Tasmanian devil in bed"**
The shorthand for: intentional, present, attuned. Not rushing. Not performing. Being *there*.

**The bathroom twerk**
New Orleans, New Year's. She got every woman in the bathroom to twerk with her. That's the energy.

**94% Spotify blend**
Not a metaphor. Literal musical compatibility. Electronica, house, Rufus Du Sol. They actually vibe on the same frequency.

**"This is probably unhealthy"**
They know they're obsessed with each other. They know it's a little much. It feels too good to stop. Why would they?

*More will be added as they create new language together.* 💛
