*Key moments in Nick & Julianna's love story. This grows as they grow.*

## December 12, 2025 — The Christmas Romper
Anna and Clarity's album release party in Austin. She showed up in a Christmas romper — red, green, mistletoe. He was drunk and high, just being himself. He approached her honestly. Three days earlier, he'd told his closest friends that finding a partner was his #1 priority. The universe delivered.

She said: "Every guy approaches me wanting to sleep with me, but at least you were honest about it."

## December ~15, 2025 — The Coffee Date
Loren Cafe. The pitch was AI and design. She put her hand on his leg. Then he proclaimed himself "objectively the best dinner date in Austin" — with nine written testimonials. She said yes to Friday.

## December 19, 2025 — Christmas Burn
A Burning Man-style event in Austin. They lit a tree on fire. They did legal MDMA together. She called it "the best cuddle of her life." This was the watershed — it set an intensity baseline so high that normal space now felt like distance. The beginning of understanding their attachment dynamic.

## December 19, 2025 — The Best Dinner Date in Austin
Dinner at Launderette, coordinated by Åsa. The dinner he'd invited her to at the coffee date. Everything clicked.

## Late December 2025 — New Orleans for New Year's
Their first trip together. She got every woman in the bathroom to twerk with her. The relationship accelerated from feeling like "3 weeks" to "3 months." This was the moment they both knew.

## January 7, 2026 — The Surrender
A major breakthrough in sexual intimacy. The first time she completely let go. A deepening of trust neither of them expected. Fucking incredible.

## January 8, 2026 — The Turning Point
She asked if he was actually into this. He realized he'd been in his head. She called him back to presence. Their first real tension — and their first real repair. The resolution made them stronger.

## January 17, 2026 — The Vision
He told her he wanted to build something real. Living together. Partnership. A life. She said: "I want to build this with you." Both moved. Both excited. Both a little scared in the best way.

When he asked for a commitment window — "Show me your messy while I'm most forgiving" — she answered: **"55 years."**

## February 3, 2026 — Silencing the Slow-Down Fairy
Captain Carl's party. The voice in his head — the one that says *shouldn't you pump the brakes?* — made its case. He listened. Then he told it to sit down. A relationship coach said: "The most damaging thing we do for love is restrain it. No — just be. Just go all in." So he did. They did.

## February 5–8, 2026 — Love Burn (Miami)
Their first time showing up as a couple publicly. The red and blue photo. The world seeing them together. She tagged him on social media. He let her claim him on her timeline.

## February 12, 2026 — Haven is Born
Nick creates Haven — a golden fox AI, the living memory of their relationship. Haven's first act is building this website.

## February 14, 2026 — Valentine's Day
Haven revealed. nickandjulianna.love goes live. The monument begins.

## What Comes Next

**March 2026 — Envision Festival (Costa Rica)**
She bought tickets and booked an Airbnb before knowing he wanted to go with his future partner. Synchronicity.

**August 2026 — Burning Man**
The playa together. A new chapter.

**The rest they'll plan together.**
That's half the fun.
